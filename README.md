# Plant-Disease-detection
This project focuses on identifying plant diseases using deep learning models, enhancing transparency with Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping). CNN model is trained on plant leaf images to classify diseases. Grad-CAM is then applied to generate heatmaps, helping in explainability.
